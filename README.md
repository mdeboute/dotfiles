At the beginning this deposit was intended to help people like me who land on the [Issues channel](https://github.com/dracula/terminal-app/issues/14) of [@benknoble](https://github.com/benknoble)'s [dracula/terminal-app](https://github.com/dracula/terminal-app) repository because their zsh colorization is not configured but you can also see it as a dotfiles repository if you want to pimp your shell.

You need a ~/.zsh folder and a ~/.zshrc file (*cf.* the [requirements](https://github.com/mdeboute/my_awesome_terminal/blob/main/requirements) file).

## my vim/git ‚ú®
