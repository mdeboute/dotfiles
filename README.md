## my zsh

This repository aims to help people like me who land on the 'Issues' channel of @benknoble's dracula/terminal-app repository because their zsh colorization is not configured. (disclaimer : i'm on macOS)

You just need a ~/.zsh folder and a ~/.zshrc file (cf. the requirements.txt file).

## my vim/git
To have a complete experience of the theme.

You just need a ~/.vim folder, a ~/.vimrc file and a ~/.gitconfig file (cf. the requirements.txt file).
